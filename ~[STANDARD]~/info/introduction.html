	Puppet is a Turing-complete, general-purpose programming language designed for use in situations where performance is crucial.
	Puppet compiles into C++ and generates quite a fast code.
	Puppet programs run natively under Windows 7+ and Linux 6.0+ (note: 64-bit architecture is required, e.g. x86_64 or arm64).
	Puppet is primarily strongly and statically typed, but it has support for weak and dynamic typing too.
	Files with source code for Puppet must have UTF-8 encoding, name consisting of English letters only and .ppt extension, otherwise they won't be recognised as valid Puppet sources.
	Puppet syntax is similar to C++ and Rust so it will be easier for you to learn the language if you're already familiar with them.
	Any declared variable is initialised with "void" by default.
	Puppet has a garbage collector: allocated memory is freed when no pointer points to it anymore. However, you can free allocated memory yourself at any time. After that Puppet automatically assigns "void" to the freed pointer (note: you can disable garbage collector by wrapping the code in an "unsafe" block).
	Since Puppet compiles into C++ it natively supports C++ API through <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/modules">modules</a> (a C++20 feature). You can import a C++ module directly into a Puppet source and it will work as a native Puppet code (note: C++23 isn't supported).
	Puppet allows you to define your own operators.
	In Puppet, operators and variables must be separated by whitespaces (U+0020) or tabs (U+0009). This (and UTF-8 support) allows the use of names like "%_U-MAD?1" or "<~私の変数~>". You can read more about the naming under "Expressions" section.
	Puppet has it's own integrated development environment — Marionette IDE. It offers syntax highlight, debugger, profiler, Git support, intuitive GUI, Noto Serif (which covers a wide range of unicode characters), CMake as a build system. Marionette IDE is lightweight and as optimised as Puppet itself. You can also use it to develop C++ projects.
