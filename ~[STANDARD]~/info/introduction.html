	Marionette is a Turing-complete, general-purpose programming language.
	Marionette compiles into C++.
	Marionette programs run natively under Windows 7+ and Linux 6.0+ (note: 64-bit architecture is required, e.g. x86_64 or arm64).
	Marionette is primarily strongly and statically typed, but it has support for weak and dynamic typing too.
	Files with source code for Marionette must have UTF-8 encoding, name consisting of English letters only and .mary extension, otherwise they won't be recognised as valid Marionette sources.
	Marionette syntax is similar to C++ and Rust so it will be easier for you to learn the language if you're already familiar with these.
	Any declared variable points to "void" by default.
	Marionette has a garbage collector: allocated memory is freed when no pointer points to it anymore. However, you can free allocated memory yourself at any time. Once freed, the pointer is nullified automatically. Or should i say, "voidified". Anyway, you can disable garbage collector by wrapping the code in an "unsafe" block.
	Since Marionette compiles into C++ it natively supports C++ API through <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/modules">modules</a> (a C++20 feature). You can import a C++ module directly into a Marionette source and it will work as a native Marionette code. You can read about it under <a href="#">[LINK]</a> section.
	Marionette allows you to define your own operators.
	Marionette has it's own integrated development environment â€” Theatre IDE. It offers syntax highlight, debugger, profiler, Git support, Noto Serif, CMake as a build system. Theatre IDE is lightweight and as optimised as Marionette itself. You can also use it to develop C++ projects.
	No, i didn't use ChatGPT to write all this.
